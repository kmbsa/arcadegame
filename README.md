This program is made for a school project so this made for me to practice coding. 

Rules:
Click to eliminate enemies on the screen (drones and spaceships)
Enemies:
- Fast drones : 50 pts
- Slow drones (Wavy movement and Crane drone) : 25 pts
- Fast Spaceship : 500 pts
- Big Spaceship : 1500 pts (click twice to eliminate)

Lose lives if an enemy passes through the right side of the canvas.
May only lose up to 3 lives then it is game over.

Must be played when browser is maximized as the clicking becomes inaccurate whenever browser does not fill screen size.

Supposedly the enemies are transparent but when I converted the psd files to png it left a black background and have no idea to fix it.
There also is supposed to be a cursor on the screen but when I implemented it the cursor does not go to the exact position of the mouse so I canceled its implementation.

Game can be easy when you pay attention, but gets difficult by attrition. Had a lot of fun creating this project.

Have fun playing this game!
